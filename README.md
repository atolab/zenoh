# Eclipse zenoh
The Eclipse zenoh: Zero Overhead Pub/sub, Store/Query and Compute.

Eclipse zenoh unifies data in motion, data in-use, data at rest and computations. It carefully blends traditional pub/sub with geo-distributed storages, queries and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.

Check the website [zenoh.io](http://zenoh.io) for more detailed information.
